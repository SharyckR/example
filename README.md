## How to Run

    pip install pyglet
    git clone https://github.com/fogleman/Minecraft.git
    cd Minecraft
    python main.py


On Mac OS X, you may have an issue with running Pyglet in 64-bit mode. Try this running python in 32-bit mode first.

    arch -i386 python main.py

or try Pyglet 1.2 which supports 64-bit mode

    pip install https://pyglet.googlecode.com/files/pyglet-1.2alpha1.tar.gz
